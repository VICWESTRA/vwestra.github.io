<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first national park created was Yellowstone
National Park, which was founded in 1872. At this
time, there was no state government to manage the
park, so the federal government served full
control, via the Department of the Interior. A
movement began to have an independent agency to
oversee federal lands, spearheaded by Robert
Sterling Yard and Stephen Mather. Yard and Mather
ran a publicity campaign to for the Department of
the Interior, writing articles praising park
qualities and benefits. This campaign resulted in
the creation of the National Parks Service on
August 25, 1916. The National Park Service Organic
Act was signed by Woodrow Wilson which mandated
the NPS to conserve the scenery and wildlife of
the National Parks. Mather was the first director
of the NPS (National Park Service, 2023). </p>

<h2>President Theodore Roosevelt Involvement</h2>

<p> Roosevelt is often called the “Conservation
President,” because of how much he impacted the
National Parks system. During his presidency from
1901-1909, he signed legislation to establish five
new national parks: Crater Lake, Oregon; Wind
Cave, South Dakota; Sullys Hill, North Dakota;
Mesa Verde, Colorado; and Platt, Oklahoma.<br><img src="Images/theodore.jpeg" alt="President" height="200" width="auto"><br> He had
also proclaimed four national monuments during his
presidency. By the end of his term, he had
reserved six predominantly cultural areas and
twelve predominantly national areas (“Theodore
Roosevelt and the National Park System.”). </p>

<section>
<h2>The National Park Service</h2>
<p>The NPS mission is to preserve the natural and
cultural Resources and Values of the National Park
System for the education and enjoyment of future
generations. There are approximately 20,000
employees who help in this conservation. The NPS
is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Interior
and is led by a director nominated by the
President and confirmed by the Senate.<br><img src="Images/Arrowhead.jpg" alt="emblem" height="200" width="auto"><br>  The emblem
was authorized in 1951 and its components are
inspired by key attributes of the National Parks
system. There is a sequoia tree and bison to
represent vegetation and wildlife, mountains and
water to represent scenic and recreational values,
and the arrowhead to represent historical values
(What We do; U.S. National Park Service).</p>
